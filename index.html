                A blindfolded woman with a sword and scale in each hand, a symbol of justice in the Pacific's Treasure Islands. With the blindfold symbolizing fairness same as through with scale, while courage for the sword, and- wait! Why do I see blood dripping on her cheeks?!

                It has always been debatable whether our justice system should allow death penalty. Sighting people’s opinions from left to right just gave me a headache on what I shall stand on — this concludes to one meaning: the stated topic is undoubtedly serious for it creates a huge controversy.

                Growing up in a household whose interests revolved around Korean culture, my family loved this certain movie created in the previously mentioned country—the Miracle in Cell No. 7. When that movie was released, I was still too young and innocent to comprehend the message being sent by the movie, on why the guy was sent to jail and penalized to death. But one thing will never be forgotten by me: my abhorrence against the policemen who manipulated the man's disability.

                Now that l am at the age where I'm able to understand the movie's meaning, it made me apply the happenings there in the Philippines. With my observation, I believe that death is starting to preempt justice; however, we must have a period inserted on that!
            </p>
            <p>
                Death penalty has not yet been legalized and approved in our country; yet, nearly five hundred crime suspects have died in police custody since the term of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte. Through the lenses of my point-of-view, that clearly took away their rights as humans to live and even as detainees to defend their selves in front of the judge's honor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, not only crime suspects but also people associated in drug trading activities were victimized by that. "Health complications" were the reasons according to the explanation of the Philippine National Police with no accompaniment of autopsy reports. Was that not suspicious? Plastic bag suffocation, strangulation to death, and many more antagonistic actions were done by the PNP to detainees. Why does it seem that we are playing the game of irony here as these “servants of justice” we call are now being shone under the shed of villainous light?
            </p>
            <p>
                In my perspective, these must all come to an end for they do not provide justice at all. Additionally, it also does not fix the justice system as well; rather, it worsens it! Legalizing death penalty is not the best answer to this big conflict for our justice system is messed up for that to be approved.
            </p>

                With all of those being stated, I now understand why Lady Justice bawled her eyes out as the scale of fairness had gone missing which she cannot find through her blood-soaked blindfold, while her sword of courage had been used in the imprudent and unjust way.
